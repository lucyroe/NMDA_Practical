## Project description

This repository contains all code and ressources concerning the Neurocognitive Methods and Data Analysis Practical (NMDA) class taught in the winter semester of 2023 at Freie Universitaet Berlin by Univ.-Prof. Dr. med. Felix Blankenburg & Dr. Timo Torsten Schmidt in the framework of the Master Cognitive Neuroscience. The aim of the class was to practice fMRI data collection, analysis and reporting. The research paradigm that was used in the mock experiment was that of **bistable tactile perception.**
